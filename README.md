### Hi there, I am Dongxian WU (吴栋贤 in Chinese) 👋

I am an enthusiast for building a trustworthy AI system. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Tokyo, hosted by Prof. [Masashi Sugiyama](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html).

🔭 My research mainly focus on:
- adversarial attacks and defenses
- data security, especially backdoor attacks and defenses
- weakly supervised learning, especially noisy labels
