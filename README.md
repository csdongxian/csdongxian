### Hi there, I am Dongxian WU (吴栋贤 in Chinese) 👋

I am a PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, a researcher dedicated to the trustworthy AI. Currently, I am co-supervised by by [Shu-Tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yisen Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/).

🔭 My research mainly focus on:
- adversarial attacks and defense
- weakly supervised learning, especially noisy labels

- **Oct 2020**: Our team (Dongxian Wu, Yisen Wang, Yanjie Li, Bin Chen) won the 1st prize in the 2020 [GeekPwn CAAD AI magic Mask competition](http://hof.geekpwn.org/zh/index.html). This is an interesting competition where competitors should craft adversarial masks to confuse the face recognition system (See [news](https://www.mgtv.com/b/334872/10358357.html?fpa=se&lastp=so_result) on Manguo (Hunan) TV). We will release our codes soon.

- **Sep 2020**: Our paper [Adversarial Weight Perturbation Helps Robsut Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05884) will appear in NeurIPS 2020. We have released our [code](https://github.com/csdongxian/AWP).
