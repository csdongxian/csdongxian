### Hi there, I am Dongxian WU (吴栋贤 in Chinese) 👋

I am a PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, and a researcher dedicated to the trustworthy AI. Currently, I am co-advised by Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Yisen Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/).

🔭 My research mainly focus on:
- adversarial attacks and defenses
- weakly supervised learning, especially noisy labels
