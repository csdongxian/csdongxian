### Hi there, I am Dongxian WU (吴栋贤 in Chinese) 👋

I am an enthusiast for building a trustworthy AI system. I received my PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, co-supervised by Prof. [Shu-Tao Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=koAXTXgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Yisen Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/). Currently, I am a Project Researcher at the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Masashi Sugiyama](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/index.html).

🔭 My research mainly focus on:
- adversarial attacks and defenses
- data security, especially backdoor attacks and defenses
- weakly supervised learning, especially noisy labels
